Timestamp,Name of Field Officer,Respondent's FIRST name,Survey I.D,Telephone number,How much money (in Ksh) did you earn in the past month? ,How much money do you have on mPesa right now? ,Do you currently participate in a merry-go-round/ROSCA?,"If you participate in a merry-go-round or ROSCA, how much money (KSH) do you contribute monthly? ","Please think about all your savings (including MPESA, ROSCA, money stored at home, AKIBA SMART etc.). In total, how much money (in KSH) did you save in the past month (30days)?",How much do you trust AKIBA SMART in general as a savings product?,What is your confidence level that AKIBA SMART would pay your savings back?,Did you tell about AKIBA SMART to your family or friends? ,"If yes, how often? ","In the past 2 months you saved with AKIBA SMART. Now, please think about the rules of AKIBA SMART: Can you describe me how it worked?","Now I will ask a more detailed question: if you saved 20Ksh in one day, how much money would AKIBA deposit in your account?","If custom answer, enter it here:","Please consider the following three different savings programs: In the first program, members are reminded to save in the morning each day.  Each day, when they save, they receive 5% extra from AKIBA SMART. For example, if a member saves 20Kh one day, he receives 1Ksh extra that day, deposited in his account. If he doesn‰Ûªt save the next day, he doesn‰Ûªt receive any extra money from AKIBA, so his balance stays the same: 21Ksh. If he saves 20 again on the 3rd day, he receives 1Ksh on the third day, and his total balance becomes 42Ksh: 21 from the first day and 21 from the third day. And this goes on every day.                                  In the second program, members are reminded to save in the morning each day. Each day, when they save, they receive a lottery ticket with 4 numbers. At the end of the day, the lucky numbers are announced. Once a member gets a lottery ticket, depending on his ticket, he might win one of 3 prizes: 10% of his savings, 100% of his savings or 200 times his savings. If he doesn‰Ûªt win any prize, he still keeps his savings that day. For example if a member saves 20Ksh these could happen:  if his ticket does not win a prize, he would keep his savings. If he wins Prize 1, he would get 2Ksh extra from AKIBA, if he wins Prize 2, he would get 20Ksh extra from AKIBA and if he wins Prize 3, he would get 4000 Ksh extra from AKIBA.  The more he saves each day, the bigger the prizes would be. This would continue every day.                                                                    The third program is similar to the previous program with the same lottery ticket. The difference is: Members receive their lottery ticket each day in the morning, regardless of their saving that day. And in the evening, the lucky numbers are announced. If a member saves in a day, he could win the same lottery prizes to receive extra money from AKIBA. If the member didn‰Ûªt save, even if he won a prize, he wouldn‰Ûªt be able to claim his prize and get the extra money from AKIBA. ","In the past two months, how did you feel on the days you did not save?",Do you see yourself as a saver in general? That is someone who saves as much as he can?,"If we offered you these 3 savings plans and if you could only choose one of them, which one would you choose to save money?",Imagine that we offered you plan 1 (match). How much would you save with it in the next month?,Imagine that we offered you plan 2 (lottery). How much would you save with it in the next month?,Imagine that we offered you plan 3 (regret). How much would you save with it in the next month?,If we offered you to continue saving with AKIBA for another full year (with the plan you had in the past month)  would you sign up? ,"Now that you saved with AKIBA in the last two months, how much did you save with the other savings programs you were using before, comparing to what you were saving before AKIBA? (Like ROSCA and MShwari)","Now that you saved money with AKIBA in the last two months, how do you feel about your savings. ","In the past two months, at what times  during the day, did you decide to save?","If custom answer, enter it here",Do you trust that the lottery was fair?,How good did you feel when you won a prize?,How bad did you feel when you didn't win a prize?,Are you in general a lucky person?,Treatment Type,Survey I.D,Respondent's LAST name,"If you saved with Akiba Smart, what did you spend the money on?","After participating in Akiba Smart for 60 days, do you feel more tempted to gamble, less tempted, or about the same?","After participating in Akiba Smart for 60 days, have you gambled any more than you usually do?","Do you have any complements, complaints or suggestions on how to make Akiba Smart a better product?"
