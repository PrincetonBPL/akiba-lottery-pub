\begin{frame}{Savings as a Policy Objective}

	\begin{wideitemize}

		\item Access to savings is an important avenue toward economic development.
		% Can be used to invest in productive assets when unable to
		% Allows for some degree of consumption smoothing when insurance is incomplete. 

		\item Poor households face savings constraints.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Only 22 percent of the world's poorest have an account at a financial institution \parencite{demirguc-kunt_global_2018}. Even less use them regularly.
			\item The prevalence of alternative strategies (livestock, cash under the mattress, informal groups, gambling, etc.) suggest a latent demand for saving.
		\end{itemize}

		\item Product design (default savings, commitment devices, reminders) targeted to problems of self-control/attentiveness have proven very cost-effective \parencite{ashraf_tying_2006,dupas_why_2013,somville_saving_2018}.
		% In addition to supply-side interventions such as bank expansions and subsidies
		% Our paper sits among the research on demand-side frictions.

	\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prize-Linked Savings}

	Prize-linked savings (PLS) provide stochastic returns to savings deposits (a lottery ticket for saving).

	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item Typically returns full principal (no negative returns).
		\item Involves both in-kind and monetary rewards.
		\item Has existed since the 17th century and can be found in both the developed and developing world.
		\item There is policy interest in using this product as a way to encourage saving \parencite{kearney_making_2010}.
	\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research Questions}

	\begin{wideenumerate}

		\item Can prize-linked savings induce account usage in low-income settings?
		\item How much of this effect can we attribute to a specific mechanism (regret aversion)?

		% Why risk-averse people play the lotteries is a puzzle with a lot of explanations. Here we focus on one.

	\end{wideenumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}

	\begin{wideitemize}

		\item Provided a mobile savings account to 311 periurban residents of Nairobi, Kenya.
		\item Experimentally vary the incentive structure (fixed versus stochastic) and information structure.
		\item Observe account activity over a 60-day period.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Estimate the effect of stochastic incentives on program savings and usage.
			\item Estimate the effect on savings by other means, consumption, and gambling.
			\item Quantify the role of regret aversion.

% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Theory of Regret}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Preferences depend on comparisons between outcomes of chosen and foregone prospects \parencite{bell_risk_1983,loomes_regret_1982}.

		\item Individuals experience regret after the resolution of prospects. Suppose state $i$ is realized, $f, g \in B$, and $f$ is chosen.

			\[ Q(f_i; g_i) = u(f_i) + R(u(f_i) - u(g_i)) \]

		\item $R$ is non-decreasing and satisfies $R(0) = 0$.

		\[ f \succsim g \leftrightarrow \sum_i p_{i} \cdot [Q(f_i; g_i) - Q(g_i; f_i)] \geq 0 \]

		\item $Q$ linear corresponds to EU theory while $Q$ convex corresponds to regret aversion.

	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identifying Regret Aversion}

	\begin{wideitemize}

		\item Regret is not experienced (not anticipated) if unchosen prospects are not resolved.

		% If you know you'll never find out about what could have happened you're just an EU maximizer.

		\item Manipulation of feedback have predictable consequences for behavior of regret averse individuals.

		% Those who know that they might regret not depositing might be induced to deposit. Those who won't resolve their lottery have nothing to worry about.

		\item This is the central test of regret aversion \parencite{filiz-ozbay_auctions_2007,zeelenberg_consequences_2004,zeelenberg_consequences_1996}.

		\item \textbf{Hypothesis}: More deposits in PLS with feedback than without.

	\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Role of Regret Aversion}

	\input{reg-mobile.tex}
	% The difference is not statistically significant, but taking the point estimate at face value then regret aversion accounts for 20% of the PLS effect.
	% Or from a polic perspective, a regret lottery will give you a better effect that a standard lottery.

		\item Policy implications
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Welfare consequences are not obvious.
			\item Revenue neutral (in expectation) compared to standard subsidies.

\begin{frame}{The Decision to Save with PLS}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item A one-shot decision problem to save under PLS. Denote $f_i$ the payoff for depositing in state $i$ of the lottery draw and $u(f_i)$ the associated VNM utility. 
	
		\item Saving without feedback satisfies

		\begin{align}
			\sum_{i=1}^4 p_i \cdot [u(f_i) + \gamma R(u(f_i) - u(0))] \geq & u(0) \\
			\sum_{i=1}^4 p_i \cdot [u(f_i) + \gamma R(u(f_i) - u(0))] \geq & u(0) + \textcolor{Triton}{ \sum_{i=1}^4 p_i \cdot \gamma R(u(0) - u(f_i)) }
		\end{align}

		\item Under standard assumptions, saving without feedback condition is stricter than always with feedback so marginal individuals will be induced to save when they expect feedback.

		\item Captures the idea that people who don't save may or may not be exposed to regret and that they take this into account ex ante.

		\item Without regret ($\gamma = 0$), there is no effect of lottery feedback.

% Notes from 3/13 presentation to graduate students

% What is the most we can say about welfare since the there is a policy focus? There can be an argument made (Gertler et al., Schaner) that habit formation might be a channel. Because it depends on choice architecture, may have to accept that welfare effects are ambiguous. See aer.103.3.387 for a discussion. Given how cheap this is to implement it might be cost-effective.

% x Better explain the insurance product (at least in the presentation)

% x What are other ways subjects could have saved during the time of the study? (esp. mobile credit/savings)? M-Shwari allows people to save using MPESA since 2012. Lockbox account paying an interest of 2-5 percent earned daily for one to six months. Also provides short term credit. Half of all M-Shwari customers do not have any other bank account. In our sample, 31% of subjects use this product. There are no treatment effects on M-Shwari usage. Our product is quite similar to M-Shwari (add as footnote). https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/Forum-How-M-Shwari-Works-Apr-2015.pdf

% x The savings variable is a stock so say account balance. Have to check the Z-Tree because maybe this is a flow variable.

% x Explain why we use a lockbox account and explain how we might expect this to affect results/generalizability. Don't assume people are aware of this feature. (Ashraf, Dupas, Aker). This is a common feature of savings products in LIMAC. We chose it because of its ubiquity and demonstrated demand. Why do people value illiquid? Present bias with sophistication, kinship taxes, etc.

% For generalizability: explain where and whether we think this product could work

% Examine the initial dropoff in the plot: is this compositional (extensive margin) or at the intensive margin?
