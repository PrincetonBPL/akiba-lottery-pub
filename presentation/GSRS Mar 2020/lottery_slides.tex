\begin{frame}{Savings as a Policy Objective}

	\begin{wideitemize}

		\item Access to savings is an important avenue toward economic development.

		\begin{wideitemize}

			\item Can be used to invest in productive assets when unable to borrow.

			\item Allows for some degree of consumption smoothing when insurance is incomplete. 

		\end{wideitemize}

		\item Only 22 percent of the world's poorest have an account at a financial institution \parencite{demirguc-kunt_global_2018}. Even less use them regularly.

		\item The prevalence of alternative strategies (livestock, cash under the mattress, informal groups) suggest a latent demand for saving.

		% Argue that there is room for policy intervention.

	\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Savings as a Policy Objective}

	\begin{wideenumerate}

	% There are both supply and demand side constraints on financial inclusion. A large of the microdevelopment literature has been devoted to addressing financal constraints.

		% Initial and transaction costs can be prohibitive for the poor \parencite{karlan_savings_2014}. 

		\item Mobile technologies, bank expansions, lowering account requirements, etc. \parencite{jack_mobile_2011,dupas_challenges_2014,dupas_savings_2009,burgess_rural_2005}.

		% In Kenya, 80\% of adults have a banking account or mobile money but only 30\% actually use it to save \parencite{demirguc-kunt_global_2018}. So there are also constraints on the consumer side.
		
		\item Subsidy experiments estimate very low interest rate elasticities \parencite{karlan_price_2018,schaner_persistent_2018}.
		
		\item Financial literacy is low in developing countries and education interventions have mixed results \parencite{miller_can_2015}.
		
		\item Product design (default savings, commitment devices, reminders) targeted to problems of self-control/attentiveness have proven very cost-effective \parencite{ashraf_tying_2006,dupas_why_2013,somville_saving_2018}.

	\end{wideenumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prize-Linked Savings}

	Prize-linked savings (PLS) provide stochastic returns to savings deposits (a lottery ticket for saving).

	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item There is policy interest in using this product as way to encourage saving \parencite{kearney_making_2010}.
		\item Has existed since the 17th century in England and common in many parts of the world \parencite{kearney_making_2010}.
		\item NS\&I Premium Bonds in the U.K. since 1956 and A-Million-A-Month in South Africa (defunct).
		\item Legal in the US since 2014.
	\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prize-Linked Savings}

	% From an (expected) revenue neutral perspective, 

	How might lotteries induce savings over regular interest-bearing accounts?

	% Related to an old question in economics about why people hold insurance and gamble.

	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item Thrill of playing \parencite{conlisk_utility_1993}.
		\item Large sums for purchasing durable goods when credit constrained/adjustment costs \parencite{herskowitz_gambling_2016}.
		\item Non-linear probability weighting \parencite{kahneman_advances_1992}.
		\item \textbf{Aversion to anticipated regret} can induce apparently risk-seeking behavior \parencite{loomes_regret_1982,bell_risk_1983,zeelenberg_consequences_1996}.
	\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research Questions}

	\begin{wideenumerate}

		\item Can prize-linked savings induce account usage in low income settings?
		\item How much of this effect can we attribute to a specific mechanism (regret aversion)?

	\end{wideenumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Provided a mobile savings account to 311 periurban residents of Nairobi, Kenya.
		\item Experimentally vary the incentive structure (fixed versus stochastic) and information structure.
		\item Observe account activity over a 60-day period.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Test the effect of stochastic incentives
			\item Quantify the role of regret aversion
			\item Limited evidence on total savings, consumption, gambling
			\item Heterogeneous effects
		\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Related Literature}
	
	\begin{itemize}

		\item Do lottery-like incentives work? 
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In the lab, lotteries effectively increase the savings rate \parencite{atalay_savings_2014,filiz-ozbay_lottery_2015}. Evidence for non-linear probability weighting.
			\item In the field, works over many domains \parencite{dizon_leveraging_2016,gajic_cost-effectiveness_2011,brune_effect_2015,loibl_testing_2016,gertler_long-term_2017}.
		\end{itemize}

		\item Contributions

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Account usage as an outcome has been given little attention.
			\item A field experiment that quantifies the role of a specific channel.
			\item One of the few tests of regret aversion outside the lab.

		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item Consistent with other studies of lottery incentives \parencite{brune_effect_2015,gertler_long-term_2017}.
			\item Can be rationalized as the subdivision of lotteries \parencite{samuelson_risk_1963}.
		\end{wideitemize}

	 ``...a negative, cognitively based emotion that we experience when realizing or imagining that our present situation would have been better, had we decided differently''
	\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Theory of Regret}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Preferences depend on comparisons between outcomes of chosen and foregone prospects \parencite{bell_risk_1983,loomes_regret_1982}.

		\item Individuals experience regret after the resolution of prospects. Suppose state $i$ obtains, $f, g \in B$, and $f$ is chosen.

			\[ \Psi(f_i; g_i) = u(f_i) + \gamma R(u(f_i) - u(g_i)) \]

		\item $R$ is strictly increasing, decreasingly concave, and satisfies $R(0) = 0$.

		\item If individuals can anticipate regret/rejoicing then it affects ex ante behavior.

		\[ f \succsim g \leftrightarrow \sum_i p_{i} \cdot [\Psi(f_i; g_i) - \Psi(g_i; f_i)] \geq 0 \]

		% Difference from reference dependence/DA? I only make relative comparisons when I know that I will experience ex post regret. Disapointment is related to what might have been in an unrealized state in the same lottery but regret is about what have been in a foregone choice (regret is action-based).

		% When choices also affect resolution/experience of regret then it can affect behavior. 

		% Is it kinked? People postulate so but no quantification

	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identifying Regret Aversion}

	\begin{wideitemize}

		\item Regret is not experienced (anticipated) if unchosen prospects are not resolved.

		\item This is the central test of regret aversion in the lab \parencite{filiz-ozbay_auctions_2007,zeelenberg_consequences_2004,zeelenberg_consequences_1996}.

		\item In our study, individuals in PLS treatments can experience regret only if they chose \textit{not} to save and learned about a winning ticket at the resolution of the daily lottery.

		% they cannot experience regret by choosing to enter the lottery because it cannot result in losses

		\item \textbf{Hypothesis}: More deposits with feedback than without.

	\end{wideitemize}

	% If lottery is more attractive in lottery then it implies R is negative here

			\item PLS can increase account usage but not savings per se.
			\item Behavior is consistent with regret aversion.
			\item Recently experienced regret reinforces subsequent effect.
			\item Little effect on other savings, consumption, gambling.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Further research
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Observe entire portfolio of assets, consumption.
			\item Investigate long-term effects.
			\item A structural approach to help quantify role of alternative explanations.
			\item Examine cost-effectiveness relative to other products.
			\item Understand learning and salience of regret.
			\item Understanding portfolio selection when all types of savings are available.

		\item Suppose $u(0) = 0$ and denote $f_i$ the payoff for depositing in state $i$. 
	
		\item Saving without feedback:

		\[ \sum_{i=1}^4 p_i \cdot [u(f_i) + R(u(f_i))] \geq 0 \]

		\item Saving with feedback:	

		\[\sum_{i=1}^4 p_i \cdot [u(f_i) + R(u(f_i))] \geq \sum_{i=1}^4 p_i \cdot R(-u(f_i)) \]

		\item $R(0) = 0$ and strictly increasing implies that $R(u(f_i)) > 0$ and $R(-u(f_i)) < 0$.

% Notes from 3/13 presentation to graduate students

% What is the most we can say about welfare since the there is a policy focus? There can be an argument made (Gertler et al., Schaner) that habit formation might be a channel. Because it depends on choice architecture, may have to accept that welfare effects are ambiguous. See aer.103.3.387 for a discussion. Given how cheap this is to implement it might be cost-effective.

% x Better explain the insurance product (at least in the presentation)

% x What are other ways subjects could have saved during the time of the study? (esp. mobile credit/savings)? M-Shwari allows people to save using MPESA since 2012. Lockbox account paying an interest of 2-5 percent earned daily for one to six months. Also provides short term credit. Half of all M-Shwari customers do not have any other bank account. In our sample, 31% of subjects use this product. There are no treatment effects on M-Shwari usage. Our product is quite similar to M-Shwari (add as footnote). https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/Forum-How-M-Shwari-Works-Apr-2015.pdf

% x The savings variable is a stock so say account balance. Have to check the Z-Tree because maybe this is a flow variable.

% x Explain why we use a lockbox account and explain how we might expect this to affect results/generalizability. Don't assume people are aware of this feature. (Ashraf, Dupas, Aker). This is a common feature of savings products in LIMAC. We chose it because of its ubiquity and demonstrated demand. Why do people value illiquid? Present bias with sophistication, kinship taxes, etc.

% For generalizability: explain where and whether we think this product could work

% Examine the initial dropoff in the plot: is this compositional (extensive margin) or at the intensive margin?
