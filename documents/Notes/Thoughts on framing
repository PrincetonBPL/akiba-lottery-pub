IResults:

reduction in avg savings
increase in number of deposits
increase in longest savings streak

no effect on actual savings behavior - duh because its not lottery linked (break this down by type)
more self-reported gambling in the regrets treat
feels like lucky person (regress with times/amount won)
effects mediated if co-habitating
regret worked better for women
had effects on total amount for undereducated (investigate this, find literature)
effects only for non-gamblers
driven by unemployed, low income, risk seekers, non-savers, over 30 yo
no continuation of AKIBA enrollment

Notes:

what is the target savings behavior for policy? (we can argue that its deposits)
what is the behavioral barrier to savings?
are these people already underbanked?
check dynamics of increases in deposit frequency
check gambling and habit formation
check whether amount saved increases over time (it doesn't)
Gambles as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving dysphoric mood (e.g., feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression). (yep)
investigate hot hand fallacy, chasing losses,
lottery winnings proportional to avg savings and could only claim after playing? then rationally they should play
can frame as a habit-formation all along
is gambling self-report about activities besides the project? maybe
pretty consistent type of gambling person
lump sum fun benefit of gambling, what do they consume with a large windfall anyway?
poor people value larger lump sum (het effect result with income while controlling for risk aversion)
might need more than 60 days for habit formation
we dont observe total portfolio
disentangle risk-seekers, probability weighting, preference for skewness, lumpy entertainment value of gambling
