Notes on ``Auctions with Regret''

	Attempt to explain overbidding in first price auctions
	The counterfactual is with respect to winning/losing the auction; with lotteries it's with respect to state
	Model derives symmetric equilibrium with regret
	Seller revenue is higher under standard assumptions (violated RET); we can say something about deposits
	Need to document how past experiments have treated feedback; maybe regret can rationalize different results; this should be a main contribution
	Actually only evidence for loser regret and not winner regret; loser regret is more intense; so on net its overbidding
	The slope of the bid functions are steeper; not everyone overbids
	CDF of bid-value coefficients by treatment group
	Structural estimation of regret intensity; how does it compare to the marginal utility of money?
	Winner regret only in first price auctions.
