We further restrict the analytic sample to those in Regret and control. The unit of observation is individual-by-period. Standard errors are in parentheses and clustered at the individual level. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct. level. \end{tablenotes} \end{threeparttable} } \end{table}
