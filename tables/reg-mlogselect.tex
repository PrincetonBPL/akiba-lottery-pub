Each row corresponds to a response category with the baseline value as . Column 1 reports the constant term corresponding to the mean of the control group. Columns 2--3 reports the treatment effect in relative risk ratios compared to the control group. Column 4 reports the difference between the two PLS treatments. Standard errors are in parentheses. Column 5 reports the number of observations in the analytic sample. Observations are at the individual level. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct. level. \end{tablenotes} \end{threeparttable} } \end{table}
