The second and third columns report the observed and expected probabilities, respectively, of each type of lottery match. A lottery ticket was a random sequence of four numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive. Prizes were awarded according to how well a participant's lottery numbers matched the winning numbers. If the first or second numbers matched, a 10\% match of savings was awarded. If \emph{both} the first and second numbers matched, a 100\% match of savings was awarded. Finally if all numbers matched, a prize of 200 times the daily savings was awarded. \end{tablenotes} \end{threeparttable} } \end{table}
